Clean, and good-looking pastel rice (Catppuccin Mocha)

![Rice Screenshot](https://github.com/Okuber/dotfiles-hyprland/blob/main/20240323_17h50m58s_grim.png?raw=true)

Dependencies:
```
neofetch
swayosd
cava
waybar
hyprland
swww
hypridle (you'll probably be fine without this if you change a few lines of the hyprland config)
kitty
wofi
```

TODOS:
- ~~Add keybinds for screenshots (I'm too lazy)~~ (done)
- Actually have a functioning lock screen
- A little polishing here and there

Note: For swww I put my wallpapers into `~/Wallpapers/Catppuccin-Rice`, if you want to put your wallpaper somewhere else, you can change it in the hyprland config.

Clean, and good-looking pastel rice (Catppuccin Mocha)

![Rice Screenshot](https://github.com/Okuber/dotfiles-hyprland/blob/main/1710773140-wayshot.png?raw=true)

Dependencies:
```
neofetch
cava
waybar
hyprland
wpaperd
hypridle (you'll probably be fine without this if you changed a few lines of the hyprland config)
wezterm
wofi
```

TO-DO:
- Add keybinds for screenshots (I'm too lazy)
- Actually have a functioning lock screen
- A couple polishing here and there

Note: For wpaperd I put my wallpapers into `~/Wallpapers/Catppuccin-Rice`, if you want to put your wallpaper somewhere else, you can change it in the wpaperd config.
